# pneumonia-detection
A web-based application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. Built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled X-ray datasets, this project allows users to upload chest X-rays and get instant predictions on whether the image shows signs of pneumonia or not.
